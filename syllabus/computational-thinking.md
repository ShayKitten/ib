# [Computational Thinking](http://moodle.clevelandhighschool.org/mod/page/view.php?id=844)

### Concepts
-*Sequence:* Identifying a series of steps for a task  
-*Loops:* Running the same sequence multiple times  
-*Scripting:* Making things happen with code and in a coding world  
-*Events:* One thing causing another thing to happen  
-*Conditionals:* Making decisions based on conditions  
-*Operators:* Support for mathematical and logical expressions  
-*Data:* Storing, retrieving, and updating values  

### Practiced
-*Experimenting and Iterating:* Developing a little bit, then trying it out, then developing more  
-*Testing and Debugging:* Making sure things work â€” and finding and solving problems when they arise  
-*Reusing and Remixing:* Making something by building on existing projects or ideas  
-*Abstracting and Modularizing:* Exploring connections between the whole and the parts  

### Perspectives
-*Creating:* Realizing that computation is a medium of creation, "I can create."  
-*Connecting:* Recognizing the power of creating with and for others, "I can do different things when I have access to others."  
-*Questioning:* Feeling empowered to ask questions about the world, "I can (use computation to) ask questions to make sense of (computational things in) the world."
